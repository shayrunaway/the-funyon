            <h2>All That Glitters Is Not Old</h2>
            <p>Glitter scientists, or glittists, have developed a new type of glitter that will no longer stick around for years to come--Going, Glowing, Gone. Gone are the days of leaving behind trails of sparkly conjunctivitis when you decide to break out your Wet 'n Wild eyeshadow palette gifted to you for Christmas '09. Going, Glowing, Gone is made up of naphthalene, the primary ingredient found in mothballs, a solid that slowly sublimates into the air. Due to the small surface area of a glit (A single piece of glitter), the glitter should disappear in 1-2 weeks when in a space with good air circulation. One reported downside is that dance clubs around the country have started smelling exactly like your favorite hide-and-seek spot at your grandmother's house. Additionally, elementary teachers whose classrooms participated in the test groups for Going, Glowing, Gone have noticed a statistically significant uptick in requests from students to play bingo and learn to crochet. <br><br>Going, Glowing, Gone is patented under the sole proprietorship of Reinventing the Wheel, LLC. Reinventing the Wheel, LLC has made a pledge that for every 100 lbs of Going, Glowing, Gone sold they will ensure at least 10 lbs of microplastics are released into the waterways to offset the alarming reduction in pollution caused by biodegradable glitter. Use at your own risk. Funyon, Inc does not take responsibility for any premature aging effects, scent-induced headaches, or sudden waves of nostalgia from using these products.</p>

            <h2>Macrofirm and Doodle CEOs Lament CWS Monopoly</h2>
            <p>In a rare moment of unity, CEOs of Macrofirm and Doodle, the second and third largest cloud computing companies, held a joint press conference today to express their outrage following the recent Congo Web Services (CWS) outage. CWS currently supports the infrastructure of effectively 34% of the internet. "Monopolies are dangerous," declared Macrofirm CEO John Johnson. "In the wrong hands the internet can be disasterous for our shareholders-I mean, our country." Doodle CEO, Jack Jackson, echoed the same sentiment, livestremaing his remarks via 14 different Doodle owned platforms. "CWS's outage shows irresponsibility that must be scrutinized. Billios of users couldn't access their data, and ad revenues plummeted by over .04%."<br><br>The outage, which began when Soylent was spilled on a integral server, caused widespread disruption. Smart fridges stopped tweeting, AI therapists forgot their patients' trauma, and one unfortunate billionaire had to adjust his own thermostat." Both CEOs insst that monopolies must be "regulated, dismantled, or handed over to more competent monopolists."</p>
